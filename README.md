In this repository one can find all the files for the project titled "Accuracy in parameters estimation of extreme mass ratio inspirals in simulated LISA data"

To replicate all computations one may need to download files "equalarmlength-orbits.h5" and "LDC2_sangria_training_v2.h5" and place them near the files which using LikelihoodCalculator class.

All inconveniences for usage will be fixed in the future.
