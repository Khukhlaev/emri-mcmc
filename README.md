In this repository one can find all the files for the project titled "Analyzing possibility of detection extreme mass ratio inspirals with Markov chain Monte Carlo"

## Content

- [`Chain files`](chain_files) - save chains files for various runs along with notebook to plot graphs
- [`Delta theta estimations`](delta_theta_estimations) - Notebooks for parameters range estimations
- [`Mcmc files`](mcmc_files) - Files used to run mcmc 
- [`Tests of signal processing`](testing_signal_processing) - Early tests of signal processing and its computation time



To replicate all computations one may need to download files "equalarmlength-orbits.h5" and "LDC2_sangria_training_v2.h5" and place them near the files which using LikelihoodCalculator class.

All inconveniences in use will be fixed in the future.
